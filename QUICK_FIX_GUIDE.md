# ðŸ”§ Quick Fix Implementation Guide

## CRITICAL FIX: Video Duration (5-10 minutes requirement)

This guide shows you EXACTLY what to change to fix the video duration issue.

---

## Option 1: Quick Fix (30 minutes) - Use Full Clips

### Step 1: Modify `config.py`

**Find these lines** (around line 13-14):

```python
CLIP_DURATION = 3.0  # seconds
TRANSITION_DURATION = 1.0  # seconds
```

**Change to**:

```python
CLIP_DURATION = None  # Use full clip or max duration
MIN_CLIP_DURATION = 8.0  # Minimum 8 seconds per clip
MAX_CLIP_DURATION = 60.0  # Maximum 60 seconds per clip
TRANSITION_DURATION = 1.0  # seconds
```

---

### Step 2: Modify `video_processor.py`

**Find this function** (around line 18):

```python
def process_single_clip(self, video_path, clip_duration=None, target_height=None):
    """
    Process a single video clip with filters and effects
    ...
    """
    clip_duration = clip_duration or CLIP_DURATION
    target_height = target_height or TARGET_HEIGHT

    clip = VideoFileClip(video_path)

    # 1. Trim to desired duration
    start_time = max(0, (clip.duration / 2) - (clip_duration / 2))
    clip = clip.subclip(start_time, start_time + clip_duration)
```

**Replace with**:

```python
def process_single_clip(self, video_path, clip_duration=None, target_height=None):
    """
    Process a single video clip with filters and effects
    ...
    """
    from config import MIN_CLIP_DURATION, MAX_CLIP_DURATION

    target_height = target_height or TARGET_HEIGHT
    clip = VideoFileClip(video_path)

    # 1. Determine clip duration
    if clip_duration is None:
        # Use CLIP_DURATION from config if set, otherwise use full clip
        clip_duration = CLIP_DURATION

    if clip_duration is None:
        # Use as much of the clip as possible (up to MAX)
        clip_duration = min(clip.duration, MAX_CLIP_DURATION)
        clip_duration = max(clip_duration, MIN_CLIP_DURATION)

        # Use the full clip if it's within bounds
        if clip.duration <= MAX_CLIP_DURATION:
            # Use entire clip - no trimming
            pass
        else:
            # Clip is too long, use best segment
            start_time = max(0, (clip.duration / 2) - (clip_duration / 2))
            clip = clip.subclip(start_time, start_time + clip_duration)
    else:
        # Use specified duration from center of clip
        start_time = max(0, (clip.duration / 2) - (clip_duration / 2))
        clip = clip.subclip(start_time, start_time + clip_duration)
```

---

### Step 3: Test

```powershell
# Add 5-6 video clips of 60 seconds each to input_videos/
# Run the system
python main.py

# Expected output: ~5 minutes (5 clips Ã— 60 seconds)
```

**That's it!** You now have 5-10 minute videos. âœ…

## Option 2: Better Fix (3-4 hours) - Scene Detection

This is higher quality but takes longer to implement.

### Step 1: Install SceneDetect

```powershell
pip install scenedetect[opencv]
```

### Step 2: Create new file `scene_detector.py`

```python
"""

        return selected_scenes
```

### Step 3: Modify `video_processor.py`

**Add this import at the top**:

```python
from scene_detector import SceneDetector
```

**Add this new method to the `VideoProcessor` class**:

```python
def process_clips_with_scene_detection(self, video_paths, target_duration=300):
    """
    Process videos using scene detection

    Args:
        video_paths: List of video file paths
        target_duration: Target total duration in seconds
    """
    print("\n" + "="*60)
    print("Using Scene Detection Mode")
    print("="*60)

    # Detect and select best scenes
    detector = SceneDetector()
    selected_scenes = detector.extract_best_scenes(
        video_paths,
        target_duration=target_duration
    )

    # Process each selected scene
    print("\nProcessing selected scenes...")
    self.processed_clips = []

    for video_path, start_time, end_time, score in selected_scenes:
        clip = VideoFileClip(video_path).subclip(start_time, end_time)

        # Resize
        clip = clip.resize(height=TARGET_HEIGHT)

        # Apply filter
        filter_func = self.video_filter.get_filter_function()
        print(f"  - Applying filter to scene from '{video_path}'...")
        clip = clip.fl_image(filter_func)

        # Add transitions
        clip = clip.fx(vfx.fadein, TRANSITION_DURATION).fx(vfx.fadeout, TRANSITION_DURATION)

        self.processed_clips.append(clip)

    print("âœ… All scenes processed.")
```

---

### Step 4: Modify `main.py`

**Find this section** (around line 60):

```python
# Step 3: Process videos
print("\n" + "=" * 60)
print("STEP 3: Video Processing")
print("=" * 60)
processor = VideoProcessor(video_filter)
processor.process_all_clips(video_paths)
```

**Replace with**:

```python
# Step 3: Process videos
print("\n" + "=" * 60)
print("STEP 3: Video Processing")
print("=" * 60)
processor = VideoProcessor(video_filter)

# Choose processing mode
USE_SCENE_DETECTION = True  # Set to False to use old method

if USE_SCENE_DETECTION:
    # Use scene detection for better quality
    processor.process_clips_with_scene_detection(video_paths, target_duration=300)
else:
    # Use simple clip processing
    processor.process_all_clips(video_paths)
```

---

### Step 5: Add to `config.py`

```python
# Scene detection settings
USE_SCENE_DETECTION = True
TARGET_VIDEO_DURATION = 300  # 5 minutes
MIN_SCENE_DURATION = 3
MAX_SCENE_DURATION = 30
SCENE_DETECTION_THRESHOLD = 27.0
```

---

### Step 6: Test

```powershell
python main.py
```

**Expected output**: High-quality 5-minute video with best scenes from all input videos! âœ…âœ…âœ…

## Which Option to Choose?

### Choose Option 1 if:

- âœ… You need quick fix (30 minutes)
- âœ… You have 5-6 good quality full clips
- âœ… You want simple, reliable solution

### Choose Option 2 if:

- âœ… You have time (3-4 hours)
- âœ… You want best quality output
- âœ… You want to impress judges with sophistication
- âœ… Your input clips are long and varied

## Testing Checklist

After implementing either option:

- [ ] Video output is 5-10 minutes long
- [ ] Music loops properly for entire duration
- [ ] No audio glitches or cuts
- [ ] Transitions are smooth
- [ ] Video quality is good (720p+)
- [ ] Emotions are detected correctly
- [ ] Music matches emotional theme
