## 🎬 What Changed from test.py?

### Before (test.py):

- ❌ 500+ lines in one file
- ❌ Hard to modify
- ❌ Colab-specific code
- ❌ Mixed concerns
- ❌ No documentation

### After (Current Structure):

- ✅ Clean modular files (5 modules)
- ✅ Easy to configure (config.py)
- ✅ Runs locally (no Colab needed)
- ✅ Separated concerns
- ✅ Comprehensive docs
- ✅ Ready for hackathon

## 📁 Project Files (What's What)

```
🚀 RUN THESE:
   main.py              # Main program
   config.py            # Settings

📖 READ THESE:
   SUMMARY.md           # Overview (start here!)
   QUICK_FIX_GUIDE.md   # Fix duration (critical!)
   README.md            # Full documentation

🧠 CODE FILES (don't need to modify):

## 💡 Pro Tips

### ⚡ For Speed:

- Use `USE_STYLE_TRANSFER = False` in config.py
- Use 720p resolution
- Process 3-5 clips at a time

### 🎨 For Quality:

- Implement scene detection (see QUICK_FIX_GUIDE.md Option 2)
- Use 1080p resolution
- Add multiple music tracks per emotion

### 🏆 For Hackathon:

## 🆘 Common Issues

### "No module named 'moviepy'"

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "Not enough videos"

- Add at least 2 videos to `input_videos/`

- Add music files to `input_music/`
- Name them: epic.mp3, calm.mp3, etc.

### "Video is only 12 seconds"

- Read `QUICK_FIX_GUIDE.md`
- Implement duration fix

### "Taking too long"

- Set `USE_STYLE_TRANSFER = False` in config.py
- Use lower resolution (720p)
